# Self-hosted AI starter kit

**Self-hosted AI Starter Kit** is an open, docker compose template that
quickly bootstraps a fully featured Local AI and Low Code development
environment including Open WebUI for an interface to chat with your N8N agents. 

This is Cole's version with a couple of improvements and the addition of Open WebUI! 
Also, the local RAG AI Agent workflow from the video will be automatically in your 
n8n instance if you use this setup instead of the base one provided by n8n!

Download my N8N + OpenWebUI integration [directly on the Open WebUI site.](https://openwebui.com/f/coleam/n8n_pipe/) (more instructions below)

## Installation

### For Nvidia GPU users

```
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/ai-agents-masterclass.git
cd ai-agents-masterclass/local-ai-packaged
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you‚Äôre using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/ai-agents-masterclass.git
cd ai-agents-masterclass/local-ai-packaged
docker compose up
```

After you followed the quick start set-up below, change the Ollama credentials
by using `http://host.docker.internal:11434/` as the host.

### For everyone else

```
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/ai-agents-masterclass.git
cd ai-agents-masterclass/local-ai-packaged
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The main component of the self-hosted AI starter kit is a docker compose file
pre-configured with network and disk so there isn‚Äôt much else you need to
install. After completing the installation steps above, follow the steps below
to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with n8n in the setup here,
   it is only a local account for your instance!
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/vTN9y2dLXqTiDfPT>
3. Create credentials for every service:
   
   Ollama URL: http://ollama:11434

   Postgres: use DB, username, and password from .env. Host is postgres

   Qdrant URL: http://qdrant:6333 (API key can be whatever since this is running locally)

   Google Drive: Follow [this guide from n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
   Don't use localhost for the redirect URI, just use another domain you have, it will still work!
   Alternatively, you can set up [local file triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).
4. Select **Test workflow** to start running the workflow.
5. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.1. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.
6. Make sure to toggle the workflow as active and copy the "Production" webhook URL!
7. Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser to set up Open WebUI.
You‚Äôll only have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with Open WebUI in the 
setup here, it is only a local account for your instance!
8. Go to Workspace -> Functions -> Add Function -> Give name + description then paste in
the code from `n8n_pipe.py`

   The function is also [published here on Open WebUI's site](https://openwebui.com/f/coleam/n8n_pipe/).

9. Click on the gear icon and set the n8n_url to the production URL for the webhook
you copied in a previous step.
10. Toggle the function on and now it will be available in your model dropdown in the top left! 

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.
To open Open WebUI at any time, visit <http://localhost:3000/>.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Local Multilanguage
With openai-edge-tts you can use a nice tts on Open WebUI on multiple languages
go to Open WebUI admin settings http://localhost:3000/admin/settings
go to Audio, on TTS Settings choose OpenAI
put this on the URL http://openai-edge-tts:5050/v1
on API Key put "password" or whatever you put on the .env OPENAI_EDGE_TTS_API_KEY
click save

it should work now, to change languages and voices, go to settings, audio
change Set Voice to any on this list eg:pt-BR-AntonioNeural (this one is from brazil)

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
